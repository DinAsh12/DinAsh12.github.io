Level 1 Starts off with the player stuck in a school. The school is distorted and appears hellish. The player has to use a light gun that shoots light beams to destroy demons/ghosts that are terrorizing the school. After the exit is found level 2 takes place outside in the small town. The player finds that there are 4 gated paths that appeared in the small town. 

<!-- more -->

The gate has a demon guardian that protects the other three gates. Then the player finds that there is an avenue called Devestation Ave. There the player walks in to the house and level 2 ends there. Level 3 is when the player explores and destroys the demons that are terrorizing the town. The backyard of the house has the boss demon who is casting the curse on this town to make the town resemble hell on earth. Once the player defeats the boss the game ends.

### What did I learn developing this game?

The game is not just about dragging and dropping. There is alot of creativity and critical thinking involved. Backing up an game with a proper story. 

Second there is alot of artistic point of views needed to create level maps and design. In order to make the school distorted there was alot of thinking to make it appear in the way shown in the screenshot. Then it takes alot of time as well to create a city map from scratch. Making a game in unity I have learned is such a challenge. This is due to the amount of time the engine makes the game malfunction. This is because certain times in the background the engine starts deleting files for updating the engine. This adds more time to run the game for testing through the engine because the engine has to be reinstalled to run the game as it used to work. 

Finally, there is also music required to make the game appealing to the ears as well. Creates more vibes to the level and the game play.

### Here are some screenshots from the game.
