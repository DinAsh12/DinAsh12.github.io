The stone is created so that it looks in toon based art.

 The level is designed so that the player has to accelerate and jump in order to reach a portal that ends the game.
There are also obstacles such as acid dumps that melts the stone and kills the player. There are cliffs so that if the player does not jump the stone will fall to break.
Finally, the game finishes only if the player correctly lands in the portal. The player loses if the stone does not bullseye the stone by accelerating and jumping inorder to
hit the portal.
